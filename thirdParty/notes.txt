For OS X Users:
* Replaced echo -n with printf in vpdetection/Makefile to avoid errors like 'VPCluster.d:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.' See "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13553426/makefile-error-missing-separator-compiling-with-sdl-and-opengl" for more detail

* After that, running make produced too many errors to compile.  Worked around this by using macports to select mp-gcc44 via sudo port select gcc mp-gcc44, and was able to run make

* To compile lsd-1.5, had to run sudo port select gcc none, then symlink a gcc-4.2 on my path to the default system gcc, e.g.
ln -s /usr/bin/gcc ~/bin/gcc-4.2

* This was still causing the following error
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk'

    mex: compile of ' "lsd_matlab.c"' failed.
Solution was embedded here:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/158273-compiling-mex-files-in-mac-10-9

Had to change the relevant line in my system's mexopts.sh from
SDKROOT='/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk' to 
SDKROOT='/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk'
Scratch that, didn't work. Instead, changed gcc back to mp-gcc44, ran
rm ~/bin/gcc-4.2
ln -s /opt/local/bin/gcc ~/bin/gcc-4.2

and tweaked the meshopts.sh CFLAGS line, removing the "-no-cpp-precomp -arch $ARCHS" options entirely... seemed to compile and run correctly
