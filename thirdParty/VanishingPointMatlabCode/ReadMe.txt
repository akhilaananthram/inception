 This document is the matlab implementation of the algorithm proposed in our papar:
 Lilian Zhang, Huimin Lu, Reinhard Koch, Vanishing Point Estimation and Line Classification in a Manhattan World with a Unifying Camera Model,  submitted to IJCV.

 In PerspectiveCamera directory, 
 You can run mainVPEstimation.m to test the vanishing point estimation algorithm for calibrated perspective cameras. 
 You can run mainVPandFocalEstimation.m to test the vanishing point and focal length estimation algorithm for uncalibrated perspective cameras.

 In CatadioptricCamera directory,
 You can run mainVPEstimation_omni.m to test the vanishing point estimation algorithm for calibrated catadioptric cameras. 
 
 
 The codes are test on Linux 2.6.37.6-0.7-desktop x86_64 system with Matlab version 2012b.
 If you have questions about the codes, please feel free to contact me: lz@mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de.
